Hello there! My name is Andreas, I'm a recent PhD graduate currently undertaking a postdoc with Prof. [Francesco Sciortino](https://www.roma1.infn.it/~sciortif/index.html) at Sapienza Università di Roma. 

I like to mess about with computers, and during the day I use them to study the self-assembly of soft matter systems. This website is meant to act as a digital scrapbook for my journey as a scientist and my other interests.

Feel free to contact me about my research or anything else [here](#contact)
