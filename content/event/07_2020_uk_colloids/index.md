abstract: 'The self-assembly of sub-micron colloidal particles is a promising bottom-up strategy for fabricating photonic crystals with a photonic bandgap (PBG) in the visible regime. Synthetic opals, formed from close-packed spherical colloidal particles, have become synonymous with photonic crystals. Yet, the PBG in synthetic opals is narrow and fragile - susceptible to even the smallest degree of disorder. In contrast, particles arranged in a cubic diamond or cubic tetrastack lattice are known to possess a wide and robust PBG between the second and third bands. However, the assembly of these sparsely populated structures has proven challenging due to the competition between glass formation and crystallisation. Using designer triblock particles, we show that two-stage hierarchical self-assembly pathways, going via tetrahedral clusters, can be exploited for the reliable formation of tetrastack crystals and avoid competition with the amorphous glassy state by suppressing the formation of five- and sevenmembered rings. Finally, we show the photonic band structures of the cubic and hexagonal polymorphs of tetrastack, where we show that the hexagonal polymorph can also support a PBG.'
